"In Egypt, there were many occupations and social classes involved in day-to-day living. In many instances if you were at the bottom of the social ladder you could climb up, you didn't have to stay a peasant you could work to bring your status up. Everyone worshipped the gods Ra, Osiris, and Isis, but also they would worship their pharaohs like gods as well. Under the pharaohs were the priests, they had the responsibility to entertain or please the said god. The Chain of Command was placed to keep everyone in check, not one person could handle all the civilians and treasures without any aid. Like the tax collector, called a vizier like stated they were in charge of collecting the peoples' tax. They were also one of the rare instances who were able to read and write, that's how they were granted ""vizier"" Also the soldiers did many things as they would fight in wars or ""quelled domestic uprisings"". They were in charge of getting the slaves, farmers, and peasants to build palaces or the famous ancient pyramids. More skilled hardworking workers had occupations of craftsmen or women and physicians. This would mostly make up the middle-class people. The creative craftsmen would often make jewelry, papyrus products, pottery, tools, and many useful things people may need . Of course, you would need merchants to sell the goods to people who would pay for it.",3.12892846350062,4.23122555224945,1.7106142891076814e-10,1.0

"One main element of an ideal tragedy is that of a single unified plot.  This means that the story follows the actions and resolution of the main character only, and focuses on the character's change of fortune froom good to bad. Another element most crucial to a tragedy is that the plot must incite both fear and pity for all who watch the play. If the play ends with a ""feel good"" moment, then it has failed as a tragedy, as it doesn't incite fear and pity. The purpose of tragedy is not to  satisfy some moral sense, but to inspire feelings appropriate to witnessing a tragedy, to experience a ""cleansing"" of watching someone else suffer.  Lastly, an ideal tragedy must have a protagonist that is not overly righteous or holy, but is not depraved; the character is somewhat middle of the road.  By having the character behave in this way it makes the story more realistic and true, making the character's journey that much more engaging for the audience.  When the audience sees a tragic event occur to a plausible character because of a mistake or slight misfortune, the feeling of tragedy is heightened because it seems more true.",3.34823182563613,3.51775345440415,1.2666220849943954e-10,1.0

"The system of ancient Egyptian government is like a pyramid. The very top of the pyramid was the gods and the pharaohs because the gods controlled the universe and because the pharaohs were believed to be able to comunicate with the gods so they were thought as god like. The gods controlled the universe and the pharaohs controlled everyone. The priest and nobles were next. Only nobles could hold government office. The priest were supposed to make the gods happy. After nobles and priest came the soldiers. The soldiers were the ones that fought in wars or quelled domestic uprisings. Soldiers were also the ones who supervised the peasants, farmers, and slaves who were involved in building such structures as pyramids and palaces. The people who were next after soilders were scribes. A scribe recorded in writing the everyday life and extraordinary happenings in ancient Egypt. Their jobs were varied and included writing letters for fellow villagers who couldn't write, recording the amount of crops harvested. After the scribes came the merchants. Egyptian merchants carried products such as gold, papyrus made into writing paper or twisted into rope, linen cloth, and jewelry to other countries. Next after merchants were artisans. Artisans created the fine artwork that often covered temples, royal tombs, and other monuments. They worked in large groups to complete engravings, paintings, and hieroglyphics. Despite artisans' skill and creativity, the upper classes often viewed them as little more than common laborers. Next after artisans were farmers. Now we're on to the lower part of the pyrimad with farmers. Farmers are the ones who harvest food. They also harvest papyrus for others(most likely scribes) to write on. Now we're on the VERY bottom of the social pyrimad with slaves and servants. The servants worked as cooks, butlers, litter carriers, and as pharaoh's dressers. The male servants also worked on royal building projects or were sent to fight in the Egyptian army. Egyptian servants did not have many rights but were usually not treated poorly. Egyptian servants could not own or inherit land. Slaves were very important in ancient Egypt as a big part of the labor force, but they were also used for many other purposes. Many slaves were house servants, gardeners, farm labor, musicians and dancers of excellent talent, scribes, and accountants.",3.80272207089915,3.51483103434524,3.7425984089622943e-08,1.0

"A true tragedy features many elements of misfortune and few of good luck. In this passage,  Aristotle outlines the faults in some so called ""tragedies,"" and what caused others to succeed. The entire point of tragedy is to invoke a deep and true feeling of pity or sadness in the reader, something they can relate to on some level. a man going from rich to poor does not invoke these feelings, and neither does a man going from rags to riches. Villians falling and heroes rising cause opposite emotions than what is to be striven for in a tragedy, so a true tragedy has to have a merely ok character, usually with a moral compass that is skewed. As the focus on this one mediocre man, they shouldn't be taken on tangents that stray from the one main topic of the story of this man.

"             The  Third Wave developed over such a short period of time by  exploiting peoples' desire to feel superior to others. It, similarly, got out of control so quickly  because ofdedication it required from it's participants.  Students  were eager to join the Third Wave,  because it made them feel stronger and more important than their peers. This is shown through  the students' willigness to incriminate their peers for not following the rules (paragraph 3).  When the students were given the oppurtunity to feel superior to their peers, they took it without a second thought. The  experiment got out of control so quickly  because of the blind dedication it required from it's participants. This blind dedication is shown in  paragraph one, when the author explains that the students were required to greet eachother with a salute, even outside the classroom.

"According to Aristotle, an ideal tragedy consists of a variety of elements: plot, character, action, diction, thought, spectacle, and song (music), however, the first three are most significant. Aristotle's main points help readers to understand tragedies, ""A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain. The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad. It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse.""  In contrast, character displays men's qualities, ""the character between these two extremes — that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty. He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous — a personage like Oedipus, Thyestes, or other illustrious men of such families.""

"Three elements that make a tragedy ideal include being based on a complex plan,  a highly prosperous, average main character, and an unmerited issue. Aristotle writes that ""A perfect tragedy...not on the simple but on the complex plan."" This shows that a good tragedy must be complex if it is to rise above others. Aristotle also writes ""...a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about...by some error of judgement or frailty. He must be one who is highly renowned..."" This proves that Aristotle believes that the main character of a great tragedy must be a man who is neither good nor evil, but somewhere in between; and that that man must be prosperous or renowned. Finally, Aristotle states ""...pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves."" Therefore, if a tragedy were to display a man such as one described above, and have a random, unforeseen misfortune befall him, the audiences would easily be able to relate. In the world, no one knows what fate has in store, and this specific setting easily allows audience members to imagine themselves as the main character. These three elements combine to make a wonderful tragedy.",2.24796328553068,2.20817790577825,2.238284793065759e-07,0.9999997615814209

"The Third Wave developed over such a short period of time because of how seriously the students reacted to the regime of the Third Wave.

This cluster of text qoutes shows how legitamately the student took directions because the students did not even hesitate to follow orders nor did they question the ethics of some of the rules. For example, not a single student questioned the morals of the salute when it was purposefully intended to resemble that of the Nazi regime's salute.

"According to the views of Aristotle an ideal tragedy is not of a good man gone bad or the opposite but rather the honest mistakes of a neutral man. In order for it to be tragic Aristotle believes that it must be both unsue fear and pity from the reader.  He believes that the fear should be derived from the reader's sense of relation to the progantist which would be acheived through painting him as a common man with both merits and fawls in his character. This is done rather than protraying the protaganist as either all good or  bad.  The pity is a direct result of the misfortune brought upon an undeserving man, if the mans downfall was do to his own vice then it would not e tragic but rather justfiied, the downfall most be caused by fatal error to make the man seem undeserving of the repercussions.

"According to Aristotle, a good tragedy should include different elements, three of which include: the ability to evoke emotions such as pity and fear, a well constructed and thought out plot that does not ""double as some maintain"", and a character's situation that shifts from good to bad. Pity and fear can be drawn out of a viewer or reader when the characters do something to bring unfortunate circumstances upon themselves. For example, Romeo and Juliet create a situation in which they both end up killing themselves over the death of the other. In Greek tragedies, the characters must live with their mistakes and suffer, while in Shakespearian tragedies, the characters die. These two are similar because each person has misfortune brought upon them by their own misjudgment.

""there would come all the way back from Europe old sausage that had been rejected, and that was moldy and white – it would be dosed with borax and glycerin, and dumped into the hoppers, and made over again for home consumption."" (3) Sinclair explains that these factories are willing to risk the health of many human beings for some more money. Not only are the factories willing to do this but the employees aswell.  Looking at this question of whether or not to use supplies to contaminate meat seems like a very simple answer. However, to the factory workers in the twentieth century, it was not. Not only was it not a simple answer there was no question.  ""There would be meat stored in great piles in rooms; and the water from leaky roofs would drip over it ... . It was too dark in these storage places to see well ... There was no place for the men to wash their hands before they ate their dinner"" (4-5) Sinclair goes on to explain that there was not an option for the workers, and the factory owners knew this.  They knew the workers needed the money to provide for their families.  To add to the atmosphere of the factories Sinclair says, ""With one member trimming beef in a cannery, and another working in a sausage factory, the family had a first-hand knowledge"" (1) The people were scared to step up for fear of backlash from their ""family"".

"Three of the main elements of a great tragedy are as follows: actions that incite pity and fear, a change of fortune from good to bad, and the exclusion of the utter downfall of the villian. Aritsotle explains that the feeling of pity and fear is ""the distinctive mark of tragic imitation"" (2). In order for one to incite those feelings from an audience, someone who is neither fully good, nor bad, has to befall a misfortune. This misfortune has to come from a good place and change circumstances for the worse. ""The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad. It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty..."" (Aristotle 3). This means that in order to have a good tradegy, one must have a main character make a costly mistake that causes them great hardship. The last element of a good tragedy is the avoidance of the utter downfall of a villain, because, according to Aristotle, ""...it would inspire neither pity nor fear; for pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves"" (2). And as stated earlier, pity and fear are one of the most necessary components to an ideal tragedy, so if villian dies a horrible death, the story won't have the necessary components. If that story has these three main elements - pity and fear, misfortune, and the avoidance of the downfall of a villian, it would make a great tragedy.",2.80301320236021,1.58900654208131,1.594344745114995e-08,1.0

"One of the elements Aristotle claims is crucial to constructing an ideal tragedy is the emphasis on building a story out of pity and misfortune. As stated in paragraph 2, Aristotle remarks that "" It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation."" Aristotle is explaining how the best method of displaying tragedy in any poem is to put the main characters in a constant state of misfortune, which is meant to drive forward the narritive as it progresses. Next, Artistotle exclaims that the main character in a tragedy should never been considered ""good or bad"", but in between the two extremes. He claims in paragraph 2, ""that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity,  but by some error of judgement or frailty"". He emphasizes that the best way to craft a main character in a tragedy is not to witness a good man suffer from misfortune or a bad man pay for his crimes, but a simple man suffer for making mistakes that may be relatable to the reader themselves. Finally, Aristotle suggests that good tragedies must always involve particular families who have evil pasts. He explains this in paragraph 3 when he states, "" Now, the best tragedies are founded on the story of a few houses — on the fortunes of Alcmaeon, Oedipus, Orestes, Meleager, Thyestes, Telephus, and those others who have done or suffered something terrible."" This describes how building narratives based around icons of tragedies enhances the feelings of pity and misfortune when the main characters experince the tragedies themselves.",3.80272207089915,3.51483103434524,1.1296414470507443e-08,1.0

"           Aristotle believes there are certain elements that come together to produce an ideal tragedy. He believes the character who commits the tragic flaw should be a fair character who is well known, and should be not a great nor terrible person. For example, in Romeo and Juliet, Romeo isn't a villian or an amazing person, but rather a typical teenage boy more than anything else.  In addition, Aristotle believes the tragic flaw should not occur due to immoral behavior by the character, but rather by an error or a mistake. For example, Romeo's tragic flaw came through his impulsive decision to marry Juliet, which wasn't a terrible, immoral act. Lastly, the plot of a tragedy should consist of a good to bad change of fortune. In the beginning of the tragedy, the character should experience something good, but his/her's fortune should turn to something bad towards the end. Overall, the ideas of a neither good nor bad character, an underserving misfortune, and a flow of a good to bad fortune are three of Aristotle's many elements of an ideal tragedy.

"According to Aristotle, one element of an ideal tragedy is that it should incite feelings of pity and fear within us. Aristotle believes that a good tragedy doesn't just show for the spectacle, but truly makes us feel for the characters, and incites those feelings of pity and fear.  As Aristotle states, ""It follows plainly, in the first place, that the change of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity: for this moves neither pity nor fear."" Aristotle also believes that another element of the ideal tragedy does not feature a turn from bad to good, but instead should feature the reverse and should go from good to bad. He believes that this turn should be brought about by a crucial mistake made by a character. The third element of an ideal tragedy is one with a single issue as its plot. Aristotle compares those with a ""double threat of plot"", like the Odyssey, as second rank. He believes that it is only considered the best because of the weakness of the audience. A true poet doesn't write just based on the wishes of the audience and because of that misses the true tragic pleasure of an ideal tragedy.",2.22056771283714,1.75612953239332,5.0812275276257424e-08,1.0
